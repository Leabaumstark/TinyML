    "The C file generated by onnx2c contains everything the model needs to run. Note, that the model cannot be changed or trained anymore. The model can, however be used to make a prediction. The generated C file contains a function called `void entry(...)` (at the end of the file). Including the generated C file in your code (via writing a header file or directly), you can call this function with a sample as input argument. The function will (in our case) return an array of probabilities for the corresponding classes, as explained before.\n",
